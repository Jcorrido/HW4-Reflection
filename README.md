# Reflection

Over the past few milestones, you've had the opportunity to apply several software engineering practices and processes in the design and implementation of a project.

### Design

1. What was most helpful about thinking about design and architecture of your project?
      
      The kanban board was crazy helpful when it came to organizing the stuff that needed to be done
      
2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?
      
      We didn't have enough meetings so sometimes I would get lost in what I had to do or what was done

3. What design methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?
      
      Definitly using the kanban board and keeping it updated with specific things we needed to do.


### Testing

1. What was most helpful about implementing integration tests and mocking in your project?

      It helped us realize where things were going wrong and allowing us to find the specifc pieces of code we needed to fix to get it to work.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

      Finding all of the possible ways something could go wrong so accounting for all possible senarios and preventing a bug from happening

3. What testing methods might you want to try again in the future on another project?

      Definitly implementing more functional and non-functional testing methods into my projects, especially when the projects become larger scale


### Process

1. What was most helpful about implementing scrum-ban in your project?

     Helped organize what needed to be done and what has been done, and allowed us to provide specifics.

2. What was most difficult? What would you do differently?

      Ensuring that it was updated with detailed explainations of what the topic was and what has been done and what needs to be done.

3. What software processes or practices might you want to try again in the future on another project?

      Kanban board is a must, as it was so easy but there are a variety of other planning methods that I would like to try out again including having more organized meetings to discuss what was done. As well as having better version control as we mainly just updated the main branch when making changes rather than having several other branchs that could be merged in.

### Overall

Considering all the design and architecture methods, testing practices, and software processes you've encountered---**compare and constrast** how the benefits of the different practices and how they might be useful together.

   UML and scrum-ban amoung others help plan out the project and ensure that everybody on the team has a good idea of what the progress on the project is and are very useful. Testing methods like black box testing was one that I had used the most as it was simply easy to perform where as whte box testing is more indepth and useful when you don't know the outcome, and could be more useful on larger projects as it gives a bit more of an indepth analysis of the system. Agile and waterfall are the two main planning forms and they have their uses depending on the size of the project. For example with this bot project my group used the waterfall model as it was small enough that we didn't have to worry about problems cropping up and could in a way brute force the coding to get it to do what we wanted, where as with agile it has a more step by step approach designed around preventing problems from cropping up and wasting time and money which is super useful for cost extensive projects in the professional world.
